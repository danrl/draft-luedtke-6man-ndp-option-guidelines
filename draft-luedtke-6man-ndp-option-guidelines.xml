  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) <xref target="RFC4861"/> is used by IPv6 hosts to discover the presence of other nodes and their roles on the link.
      It features important connectivity functionality such as link-layer address discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) as defined by <xref target="RFC4862"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      Proposed NDP options usually consist of fields with fixed or variable length, designed to contain lifetime information, flags, addresses, prefixes, or other values.
      For each of the fields there are best practices for how to design them.
      These best practices keep in mind future protocol expansion, protocol implementation, and network and system behavior.
    </t>
    <t>
      Unlike DHCPv6 (<xref target="RFC3315"/>), NDP is usually implemented in the operating system kernel.
      Frequent kernel updates due to new NDP options are seen critically.
      This requires new NDP option proposals to clearly state the necessity and the benefits of a new option.
    </t>
    <t>
      This document is envisaged as a help for protocol developers that define new NDP options and for expert reviewers that review submitted proposals.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Terminology">
    <t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in  <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.
    </t>
    <t>
      The terms "link", "node", "host" and "router" in this document are to be interpreted as described in the "Terminology" section of <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="need" title="Considerations on the necessity">
    <t>
      TODO: this whole section is currently just a bunch of dropped in comments!
      <list style="letters">
        <t>In the introduction you can add a few paragraph on RA options and
        explain that in most systems these options are implemented in the OS
        kernel and because of this when a new RA option is standardized,
        kernel change and reboot becomes a necessity. Such operations are
        considered time taking and heavy on the routers.</t>
        <t>We can also discuss arguments against this: in most cases all systems
        go though some improvements in their software and usually new versions
        are regularly implemented and deployed and such changes are usually
        carried out in certain times of the day where the usage rates are
        smallest, i.e. midnights, etc. So the idea is that new RA options can
        be introduced during these rev-ups.
</t>
        <t>On the other hand Neighbor Discovery protocol options have a different
        dynamic. ND options are introduced when a new interface is defined and
        when there is a need to define IPv6 operation over such an interface.
        So if there is a need to communicate using this new interfaces, all ND
        options defined need to implemented. You can give RFC 6775 as an
        example.</t>
            <t>
              So, although a given solution would work, and might even be space, time, or aesthetically optimal, a given option is presented with a series of ever-worsening challenges to be adopted:
              <list>
                <t>If it doesn't fit neatly into existing configuration files.</t>
                <t>If it requires source code changes to be adopted and, hence, upgrades of deployed software.</t>
                <t>If it requires behavior changes or new timers to be adopted and, hence, upgrades of deployed software.</t>
                <t>If it does not share its deployment fate in a general manner with other options, standing alone in requiring code changes or reworking configuration file syntaxes.</t>
                <t>If the option would work well in the particular deployment environment the proponents currently envision, but it has equally valid uses in some other environment where the proposed option format would fail or would produce inconsistent results.</t>
              </list>
              There are many things Router Advertisement option creators can do to avoid the pitfalls in this list entirely, or failing that, to make software implementors' lives easier and improve the options chances for widespread adoption.
            </t>
            <t>

            </t>
      </list>
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="considerations" title="Considerations on the Options">
    <section anchor="single-combined" title="Classification of Options">
      <t>
        Router Advertisement options can be classified as follows:
        <list style="letters">
          <t>Singleton options providing parameters related to all or no prefixes or routes, and</t>
          <t>Combined options providing parameters related to one or more specific prefixes or routes, and</t>
          <t>Options expanding the capacity of a field of an existing option.</t>
        </list>
        Being aware of the classification of the proposed option is essential for a consistent definition and implementation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="single" title="Considerations on Singleton Options">
      <t>
        Implementers MUST be able to decide which prefixes or routes a singleton option applies to.
        If there is considerable amount of difficulty to decide on the prefixes, the new document should clarify it in the text.
        If it cannot be clearly explained then the right approach is to make the association explicit by using combined options, see <xref target="comb"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Examples of such options are given in <xref target="RFC6106"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="comb" title="Considerations on Combined Options">
      <t>
        Stacking more than one data results in combined options.
        Care should be taken in using combined options.
        Data that are associated with each other should be combined together.
        Otherwise it should be preferred to declare them as singleton options.
        In combined options each piece of data is defined as fields of the option.
      </t>
      <t>
        When defining a new option, the most important question to answer is what will be the host's behavior when it receives the option.
        If this question cannot be answered without associating the option's data with another option's data then such an option is a good candidate for combining.
      </t>
      <t>
        It should be noted that combined options are typically used in defining data that are associated with route prefixes.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="exp" title="Considerations on Expanding Options">
      <t>
        An option expanding the capacity of an existing option's field inherits the class of its parent option.
        An option expanding the capacity of a NDP field MUST always be a singleton option.
        An example is given in <xref target="RFC5175"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="fieldsizes" title="Considerations on Field Sizes">
      <t>
        Fields in RA options can have a fixed or a variable length.
        The size of a fixed length field SHOULD be chosen so that the field fits into a standard type, such as uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t.
      </t>
      <t>
        Documents defining smaller fields that can be considered as flags, i.e. fields of one or two bits, SHOULD make use of the Flags Expansion option as defined in <xref target="RFC5175"/>, if applicable.
      </t>
      <t>
        Fields containing prefixes or addresses or lists of such MUST be sized using a multiple of 16 octets.
        For example, such a field SHOULD NOT be specified of length smaller than sizeof(struct in6_addr).
        Otherwise implementations may be forced to fill the field using inet_pton() or define it to be of variable length, which is strongly discouraged.
       </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="fieldvalues" title="Considerations on Field Values">
      <t>
        Documents proposing options including a lifetime field SHOULD use unsigned integers and MAY use units of seconds.
        A lifetime of zero SHOULD indicate that the option is no longer valid.
        The latter is important when it is required to invalidate the option.
        Options in need of a special value for infinity SHOULD use the lifetime field's maximum value (e.g. 65535 in case of 16-bit unsigned integer).
        Any other non-zero value MAY be defining the option's lifetime in seconds.
      </t>
      <t>
        The starting octet for IPv6 addresses or prefixes or lists of such SHOULD be a multiple of 8.
        In cases where this is not feasible, the starting octet SHOULD be a multiple of 4.
      </t>
      <t>
        Options containing domain names or lists of such, SHOULD encode the data using the technique described in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
        By this technique, each domain name is represented as a sequence of labels ending in a zero octet, defined as domain name representation.
        For more than one domain name, the corresponding domain name representations are concatenated as they are.
        Note that for the simple decoding, the domain names MUST NOT be encoded in a compressed form, as described in Section 4.1.4 of <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
        Remaining octets other than the encoding parts of the domain name representations MUST be padded with zeros.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="alignment" title="Considerations on Alignment">
      <t>
        RA options MUST align to the next 8 octet boundary.
        Documents defining new options SHOULD define unused octects to be set to zero.
        Padding wiht zeroes to the next 8 octet boundary is common practice.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="packetsize" title="Considerations on Packet Size">
      <t>
      When defining new options, sometimes the maximum transmission unit
   size issues need to be considered.  In this case, a rough worst case
   calculation should be undertaken. We present such a calculation below.
      </t>
      <t>
        Neighbor Discovery Protocol messages SHOULD NOT be subject to fragmentation.
        Therefore, a NDP option's overall length is bounded by the following upper limit:
      </t>
      <figure align="center"><artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
              IPv6 Minimum MTU   1280 [octets]
-           IPv6 header length     40 [octets]
-            NDP header length     16 [octets] (TODO: This covers RA, check others)
- Expanded Flags option length      8 [octets]
----------------------------------------------
                                 1216 [octets]
                                 =============
      ]]></artwork>
      </figure>
      <t>
        A NDP option's overall length MUST NOT exceed 1216 octets.
      </t>
      <t>
        Documents proposing large or variable length options SHOULD include an analysis clearly indicating that the size is not exceeded.
      </t>
    </section>
        <section anchor="multiple" title="RAs Spanning Over Multiple Packets">
        <t>
        Due to many and/or large options, a NDP may not fit into a single packet, such RAs are called RAs spanning over multiple packets.
        In this case the node sends multiple NDP messages with identical ICMPv6 header, filling each of the messages with different options.
        </t>
        <t>
        Note that, if used, the Flags Expansion option as defined in <xref target="RFC5175"/> is present in all NDP messages with identical ICMPv6 header.
      </t>
        </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor="conclusion" title="Recommended Sections">
    <t>
      NDP messages are sent from nodes that can have diffrent roles assigned, such as router or host.
      A new document MUST include a section for each of these entities if they use different options or use options differently.
      In other sections the need for the new option(s) are explained.
      Usually each option is detailed in separate sections.
    </t>

    <section anchor="rule55" title="Section on Host Configuration ">
      <t>
        This section defines the host behavior related to the option(s) defined.
        It should be specified under which conditions the option(s) defined can be ignored.
      </t>
      <t>
        In case the host should not ignore the option(s) defined, this section should explain what should the host do, where the information is stored and how the networking behavior of the host will change after receiving the option(s).
      </t>
      <t>
        Host behavior should be detailed based on the field values defined in the new option(s). Each new field may carry different values that require attention by the host. These should be clearly explained.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="newoptions" title="Section on Router Configuration">
      <t>
        This section defines the router behavior related to the option(s) defined.
        This includes a description of required behavior of the router in sending this option(s) to the hosts.
        It should also include what the routers should avoid, i.e. the behavior that is not allowed.
      </t>
      <t>
        Router behavior should be detailed based on the fields defined in the new option(s).
        Each new field should be covered in detail.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section anchor="configuration" title="Example: RDNSS option in Router Advertisements">
    <t>
      Router Advertisement options are sent to all hosts on a link.
      The parameters are the same for all hosts on link.
      This may be only one host on point-to-point links.
    </t>
    <t>
      In Router Advertisements, for example, NDP options are commonly used to distribute
      <list style="letters">
        <t>on-link specific parameters, such as network layer parameters or route prefixes, and</t>
        <t>related configuration parameters, such as DNS configuration (cp. <xref target="RFC6106"/>).</t>
      </list>
      While all major operating system kernels provide a way to accept on-link parameters, the turnout on related configuration parameters is lower.
      One reason is, that NDP messages are usually processed by the operating system kernel.
      Related configuration parameters often contain data that is processed outside the kernel, in user space.
      It is therefore advised, to assess proposed NDP options with respect to kernel implementation.
      NDP option developers should consider how a low implementation turnout affects the overall goal of the proposed options.
