1.  Introduction

   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) [RFC4861] is used by IPv6 hosts to
   discover the presence of other nodes and their roles on the link.  It
   features important connectivity functionality such as link-layer
   address discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) as
   defined by [RFC4862].

   Proposed NDP options usually consist of fields with fixed or variable
   length, designed to contain lifetime information, flags, addresses,
   prefixes, or other values.  For each of the fields there are best
   practices for how to design them.  These best practices keep in mind
   future protocol expansion, protocol implementation, and network and
   system behavior.

   Unlike DHCPv6 ([RFC3315]), NDP is usually implemented in the
   operating system kernel.  Frequent kernel updates due to new NDP
   options are seen critically.  This requires new NDP option proposals
   to clearly state the necessity and the benefits of a new option.

   This document is envisaged as a help for protocol developers that
   define new NDP options and for expert reviewers that review submitted
   proposals.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms "link", "node", "host" and "router" in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in the "Terminology" section of
   [RFC4861].

3.  Adoption Challenges

   New NDP options face an implementation and deployment challenge:

   a.  In most operating systems, NDP options are implemented in the
       kernel.  If a new NDP option is standardized, kernel changes and
       reboot becomes a necessity.  Such operations are considered time
       taking and heavy on nodes, especially intermediate systems such
       as routers.

   b.  On the other hand, many systems undergo updates regularly.
       Usually new versions are regularly implemented and deployed.
       Such changes are usually carried out in certain times of the day
       where the usage rates are small, i.e. midnights.

   NDP options influence the behavior of nodes on a link.  IPv6 supports
   many link technolgies, some using link-specific optimization such as
   described in [RFC6775].  New NDP option developers SHOULD consider
   how the new NDP option impacts the interaction of nodes on a link,
   taking into account different link technologies.

   Although a given NDP option would work, and might even be space,
   time, or aesthetically optimal, a given option is presented with a
   series of ever-worsening challenges to be adopted:

   a.  If it doesn't fit neatly into existing configuration files.

   b.  If it requires source code changes to be adopted and, hence,
       upgrades of deployed software.

   c.  If it requires behavior changes or new timers to be adopted and,
       hence, upgrades of deployed software.

Internet-Draft            RA Option Guidelines                 July 2016


   d.  If it does not share its deployment fate in a general manner with
       other options, standing alone in requiring code changes or
       reworking configuration file syntaxes.

   e.  If the option would work well in the particular deployment
       environment the proponents currently envision, but it has equally
       valid uses in some other environment where the proposed option
       format would fail or would produce inconsistent results.

   There are many things NDP option developers can do to avoid the
   pitfalls in this list entirely, or failing that, to make software
   implementors' lives easier and improve the options chances for
   widespread adoption.

4.  Considerations on the Options

4.1.  Classification of Options

   Router Advertisement options can be classified as follows:

   a.  Singleton options providing parameters related to all or no
       prefixes or routes, and

   b.  Combined options providing parameters related to one or more
       specific prefixes or routes, and

   c.  Options expanding the capacity of a field of an existing option.

   Being aware of the classification of the proposed option is essential
   for a consistent definition and implementation.

4.2.  Considerations on Singleton Options

   Implementers MUST be able to decide which prefixes or routes a
   singleton option applies to.  If there is considerable amount of
   difficulty to decide on the prefixes, the new document should clarify
   it in the text.  If it cannot be clearly explained then the right
   approach is to make the association explicit by using combined
   options, see Section 4.3.

   Examples of such options are given in [RFC6106] and
   [I-D.ietf-mif-mpvd-ndp-support].

4.3.  Considerations on Combined Options

   Stacking more than one data results in combined options.  Care should
   be taken in using combined options.  Data that are associated with
   each other should be combined together.  Otherwise it should be



Luedtke & Sarikaya       Expires January 5, 2017                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            RA Option Guidelines                 July 2016


   preferred to declare them as singleton options.  In combined options
   each piece of data is defined as fields of the option.

   When defining a new option, the most important question to answer is
   what will be the host's behavior when it receives the option.  If
   this question cannot be answered without associating the option's
   data with another option's data then such an option is a good
   candidate for combining.

   It should be noted that combined options are typically used in
   defining data that are associated with route prefixes.

4.4.  Considerations on Expanding Options

   An option expanding the capacity of an existing option's field
   inherits the class of its parent option.  An option expanding the
   capacity of a NDP field MUST always be a singleton option.  An
   example is given in [RFC5175].

4.5.  Considerations on Field Sizes

   Fields in RA options can have a fixed or a variable length.  The size
   of a fixed length field SHOULD be chosen so that the field fits into
   a standard type, such as uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t.

   Documents defining smaller fields that can be considered as flags,
   i.e. fields of one or two bits, SHOULD make use of the Flags
   Expansion option as defined in [RFC5175], if applicable.

   Fields containing prefixes or addresses or lists of such MUST be
   sized using a multiple of 16 octets.  For example, such a field
   SHOULD NOT be specified of length smaller than sizeof(struct
   in6_addr).  Otherwise implementations may be forced to fill the field
   using inet_pton() or define it to be of variable length, which is
   strongly discouraged.

4.6.  Considerations on Field Values

   Documents proposing options including a lifetime field SHOULD use
   unsigned integers and MAY use units of seconds.  A lifetime of zero
   SHOULD indicate that the option is no longer valid.  The latter is
   important when it is required to invalidate the option.  Options in
   need of a special value for infinity SHOULD use the lifetime field's
   maximum value (e.g. 65535 in case of 16-bit unsigned integer).  Any
   other non-zero value MAY be defining the option's lifetime in
   seconds.

Internet-Draft            RA Option Guidelines                 July 2016


   The starting octet for IPv6 addresses or prefixes or lists of such
   SHOULD be a multiple of 8.  In cases where this is not feasible, the
   starting octet SHOULD be a multiple of 4.

   Options containing domain names or lists of such, SHOULD encode the
   data using the technique described in Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].  By
   this technique, each domain name is represented as a sequence of
   labels ending in a zero octet, defined as domain name representation.
   For more than one domain name, the corresponding domain name
   representations are concatenated as they are.  Note that for the
   simple decoding, the domain names MUST NOT be encoded in a compressed
   form, as described in Section 4.1.4 of [RFC1035].  Remaining octets
   other than the encoding parts of the domain name representations MUST
   be padded with zeros.

4.7.  Considerations on Alignment

   RA options MUST align to the next 8 octet boundary.  Documents
   defining new options SHOULD define unused octects to be set to zero.
   Padding wiht zeroes to the next 8 octet boundary is common practice.

4.8.  Considerations on Packet Size

   When defining new options, sometimes the maximum transmission unit
   size issues need to be considered.  In this case, a rough worst case
   calculation should be undertaken.  We present such a calculation
   below.

   Neighbor Discovery Protocol messages SHOULD NOT be subject to
   fragmentation.  Therefore, a NDP option's overall length is bounded
   by the following upper limit:

                 IPv6 Minimum MTU   1280 [octets]
   -           IPv6 header length     40 [octets]
   -            NDP header length     16 [octets] (TODO: This covers RA
   - Expanded Flags option length      8 [octets]        check others)
   ----------------------------------------------
                                    1216 [octets]
                                    =============

   A NDP option's overall length MUST NOT exceed 1216 octets.

   Documents proposing large or variable length options SHOULD include
   an analysis clearly indicating that the size is not exceeded.

4.9.  NDP Messages Spanning Over Multiple Packets

   Due to many and/or large options, a NDP message may not fit into a
   single packet, such NDP messages are called NDP messages spanning
   over multiple packets.  In this case the node sends multiple NDP
   messages with identical ICMPv6 header, filling each of the messages
   with different options.

   Note that, in case of Router Advertisements, the Flags Expansion
   option as defined in [RFC5175] is present in all NDP messages with
   identical ICMPv6 header.

5.  Recommended Sections

   NDP messages are sent from nodes that can have diffrent roles
   assigned, such as router or host.  A new document MUST include a
   section for each of these entities if they use different options or
   use options differently.  In other sections the need for the new
   option(s) are explained.  Usually each option is detailed in separate
   sections.

5.1.  Section on Host Configuration

   This section defines the host behavior related to the option(s)
   defined.  It should be specified under which conditions the option(s)
   defined can be ignored.

   In case the host should not ignore the option(s) defined, this
   section should explain what should the host do, where the information
   is stored and how the networking behavior of the host will change
   after receiving the option(s).

   Host behavior should be detailed based on the field values defined in
   the new option(s).  Each new field may carry different values that
   require attention by the host.  These should be clearly explained.

5.2.  Section on Router Configuration

   This section defines the router behavior related to the option(s)
   defined.  This includes a description of required behavior of the
   router in sending this option(s) to the hosts.  It should also
   include what the routers should avoid, i.e. the behavior that is not
   allowed.

   Router behavior should be detailed based on the fields defined in the
   new option(s).  Each new field should be covered in detail.

6.  Example: RDNSS option in Router Advertisements

   Router Advertisement options are sent to all hosts on a link.  The
   parameters are the same for all hosts on link.  This may be only one
   host on point-to-point links.

   In Router Advertisements, for example, NDP options are commonly used
   to distribute

   a.  on-link specific parameters, such as network layer parameters or
       route prefixes, and

   b.  related configuration parameters, such as DNS configuration (cp.
       [RFC6106]).

   While all major operating system kernels provide a way to accept on-
   link parameters, the turnout on related configuration parameters is
   lower.  One reason is, that NDP messages are usually processed by the
   operating system kernel.  Related configuration parameters often
   contain data that is processed outside the kernel, in user space.  It
   is therefore advised, to assess proposed NDP options with respect to
   kernel implementation.  NDP option developers should consider how a
   low implementation turnout affects the overall goal of the proposed
   options.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document shares the security issues of Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol that are documented in the "Security Considerations" section
   of [RFC4861].

8.  IANA Considerations

   None.
